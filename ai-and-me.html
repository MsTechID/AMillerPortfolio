            This four lesson mini-unit engages students in meaningful scenario-based
            learning to help them use generative AI in ways that promote digital
            citizenship and educational ethics.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Students are increasingly exposed to generative AI, but most elementary
        classrooms lack structured, age-appropriate guidance on their use. As a
        result, students are often unclear about how AI systems work, what
        information is safe to share, and how best to use AI for learning without
        crossing into cheating or plagiarism.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ===== Solution ===== -->
  <section style="background:var(--panel-mid);">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>

      <p>
        Following consultation with district stakeholders, I designed an
        in-person, four lesson mini-unit. This format supports peer discussion as
        students work through realistic AI safety and ethics scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        In-person instruction also enables collaborative creation of a final
        “AI Code of Honor,” giving students shared ownership of the commitments
        established by the class.

      <h2 style="color:#ffffff;">My Process</h2>

      <h3 style="color:#ffffff; font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:2.5rem; letter-spacing:0.04em;">
        Analysis
      </h3>
      <p>
        Following the ADDIE model, I began with an analysis of the instructional
        problem, desired outcomes, learners, and learning environment. I
        interviewed classroom teachers and the district curriculum director to
        identify key concerns regarding AI use for this age group.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also conducted student interviews to understand prior knowledge,
        perceptions, and preferences.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#ffffff; font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:2.5rem; letter-spacing:0.04em;">
        Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        Using insights from the analysis phase, I established three primary
        learning goals:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Students can distinguish between safe and unsafe information to share with AI tools.</li>
        <li>Students can identify common “red flag” patterns in AI messages.</li>
        <li>Students can recognize the difference between learning support and cheating with AI.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To assess these goals, I designed a culminating performance task: a
        collaboratively created AI Code of Honor. This task serves as both an
        authentic assessment and a shared commitment to responsible AI use.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#ffffff; font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:2.5rem; letter-spacing:0.04em;">
        Development
      </h3>
      <p>
        After establishing the core design tenets, I developed the full set of
        student-facing materials and teacher guides. Materials were reviewed for
        clarity and accessibility, and a small usability pilot was conducted to
        identify areas for refinement prior to full implementation.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#ffffff; font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:2.5rem; letter-spacing:0.04em;">
        Planned Implementation &amp; Evaluation
      </h3>
      <p>
        At the time of this portfolio submission, the unit has been fully designed
        and developed but has not yet completed a full in-class pilot.
      </p>

      <p>
        During implementation, I plan to observe student engagement during
        scenario discussions, review student contributions to the AI Code of
        Honor, and collect informal teacher feedback. These data will inform
        refinements to pacing, clarity, and scenario complexity.
