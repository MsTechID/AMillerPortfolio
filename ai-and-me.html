    <h1>AI &amp; Me: Safe, Smart, and Ethical</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>AI &amp; Me</strong> is a four-lesson instructional mini-unit designed
      for 5th–6th grade students. The unit introduces generative AI through
      age-appropriate, scenario-based learning focused on digital citizenship,
      ethical use, and critical thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students explore what AI is, how it works at a conceptual level, what
      information is safe to share, and how to distinguish between appropriate
      learning support and academic dishonesty. The unit culminates in a
      collaboratively created <em>AI Code of Honor</em>, reinforcing shared
      responsibility and ethical decision-making.

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Students are increasingly exposed to generative AI, but most elementary
      classrooms lack structured, age-appropriate guidance on its use. As a result,
      students are often unclear about how AI systems work, what information is safe
      to share, and how to use AI for learning without crossing into cheating or
      plagiarism.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      Following consultation with district stakeholders, I designed an in-person,
      four-lesson mini-unit that supports peer discussion and collaborative learning.
      Students work through realistic AI safety and ethics scenarios and collaboratively
      create an <em>AI Code of Honor</em>, giving them shared ownership of ethical
      commitments.
    </p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Using the ADDIE model, I began with an analysis of the instructional problem,
      learners, learning environment, and desired outcomes. I interviewed classroom
      teachers and the district curriculum director to identify key concerns regarding
      AI use for this age group. I also conducted student interviews to understand
      prior knowledge, perceptions, and preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      Based on analysis findings, I established three primary learning goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students can distinguish between safe and unsafe information to share with AI tools.</li>
      <li>Students can identify common AI “red flag” patterns (urgency, rewards, suspicious links).</li>
      <li>Students can recognize the difference between appropriate learning support and cheating.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To assess these goals, I designed a culminating performance task: a collaboratively
      created <strong>AI Code of Honor</strong>. This task serves as both an authentic
      assessment and a shared commitment to responsible AI use.
    </p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      After establishing core design decisions, I developed student-facing materials
      and teacher guides. All materials were reviewed for clarity and accessibility,
      and a small usability pilot was conducted to identify areas for refinement prior
      to full implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>Planned Implementation &amp; Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of this portfolio submission, the unit has been fully designed and
      developed but has not yet completed a full in-class pilot. A classroom
      implementation is planned for a future instructional cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      During implementation, I plan to observe student engagement, review student
      contributions to the AI Code of Honor, and collect informal teacher feedback.
      These data points will inform revisions to pacing, clarity, and scenario
      complexity.
