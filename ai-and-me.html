    <h1>AI &amp; Me: Safe, Smart, and Ethical</h1>

    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      This four-lesson mini-unit engages students in meaningful, scenario-based
      learning to help them use generative AI in ways that promote digital
      citizenship and educational ethics.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Audience:</strong> 5th–6th grade students</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Instructional designer
      (lesson planning, time mapping, activity design, visual design)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Format:</strong> In-person instruction with printable materials
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Four 40-minute sessions
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Students are increasingly exposed to generative AI, but most elementary
      classrooms lack structured, age-appropriate guidance on its use. As a
      result, students are often unclear about how AI systems work, what
      information is safe to share, and how to use AI as a learning support
      without crossing into cheating or plagiarism.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Following consultation with district stakeholders, I designed an in-person,
      four-lesson mini-unit. This format supports peer discussion as students work
      through realistic AI safety and ethics scenarios. In-person instruction
      also enables collaborative creation of a final <em>AI Code of Honor</em>,
      giving students shared ownership of the commitments established by the
      class.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Following the ADDIE model, I began with an analysis of the instructional
      problem, desired outcomes, learners, and learning environment. I interviewed
      classroom teachers and the district curriculum director to identify key
      concerns regarding AI use for this age group. I also conducted student
      interviews to better understand prior knowledge, perceptions, and learning
      preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      Using insights from the analysis phase, I established three primary learning
      goals for the mini-unit:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Students can distinguish between safe and unsafe information to share
        with AI tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Students can identify common “red flag” patterns in AI messages
        (e.g., urgency, rewards, suspicious links).
      </li>
      <li>
        Students can recognize the difference between appropriate learning
        support and cheating with AI.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To assess these goals, I designed a culminating performance task: a
      collaboratively created <em>AI Code of Honor</em>. This task functions both
      as an authentic assessment and as a shared commitment to responsible AI use.
      Analysis findings also informed the decision to deliver the unit in person
      and to structure it as four 40-minute lessons.
    </p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      After establishing the core design tenets, I developed the full set of
      student-facing materials and teacher guides. All materials were reviewed
      for clarity and accessibility, and I conducted a small usability pilot to
      identify areas for refinement prior to full implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>Planned Implementation &amp; Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of this portfolio submission, the unit has been fully designed
      and developed but has not yet completed a full in-class pilot. A classroom
      implementation is planned for a future instructional cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      During implementation, I plan to observe student engagement during scenario
      discussions, review student contributions to the AI Code of Honor, and
      collect informal teacher feedback on pacing, clarity, and usability of
      materials. These data points will be used to refine lesson timing, clarify
      instructions, and adjust scenario complexity as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success will be indicated by students’ ability to accurately categorize
      scenarios, articulate reasoning during discussions, and collaboratively
      produce a Code of Honor that reflects the unit’s learning goals.
