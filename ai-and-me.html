    <p class="synopsis">
      This four-lesson mini-unit engages students in meaningful scenario-based
      learning to help them use generative AI in ways that promote digital
      citizenship and educational ethics.

<!-- PROBLEM & SOLUTION -->
<section class="band band-problem">
  <div class="band-inner">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Students are increasingly exposed to generative AI, but most elementary
      classrooms lack structured, age-appropriate guidance on their use. This
      results in confusion around how AI works, what information is safe to
      share, and how to use AI responsibly in learning contexts.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      After consulting with district stakeholders, I designed an in-person,
      four-lesson mini-unit. The unit supports peer discussion and guided
      exploration of realistic scenarios. Students collaboratively create an
      “AI Code of Honor,” fostering shared ownership of ethical AI use.

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Following the ADDIE model, I performed a needs analysis of learners,
      outcomes, and context. Interviews with teachers and curriculum directors
      informed key concerns around AI usage and learner needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      Based on analysis insights, I established three core learning goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Distinguish safe from unsafe AI interactions</li>
      <li>Identify common “red flag” patterns in AI output</li>
      <li>Recognize appropriate vs. inappropriate AI use in learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The culminating task — a collaboratively created AI Code of Honor — serves both assessment and ownership purposes.</p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      Materials and teacher guides were developed with clarity and accessibility
      in mind. A usability pilot informed revisions prior to broader implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>Planned Implementation &amp; Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      While the unit is fully developed, a full classroom pilot is planned
      for a future instructional cycle. I will observe engagement, review
      contributions to the AI Code of Honor, and collect teacher feedback to
      refine pacing, clarity, and complexity.
