    <h1>AI &amp; Me: Safe, Smart, and Ethical</h1>

      A four-lesson instructional unit designed to help upper-elementary students
      use generative AI responsibly, safely, and ethically.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>
      This four-lesson mini-unit engages students in meaningful, scenario-based
      learning to help them use generative AI in ways that promote digital
      citizenship and educational ethics.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>5th–6th grade students</p>

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      Instructional designer (lesson planning, time mapping, activity design,
      visual design)
    </p>

    <h3>Format</h3>
    <p>In-person instruction with printable materials</p>

    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>Four 40-minute sessions</p>

<!-- PROBLEM / SOLUTION -->
<section class="band band-testimonials">
  <div class="band-inner">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Students are increasingly exposed to generative AI, but most elementary
      classrooms lack structured, age-appropriate guidance on its use. As a
      result, students are often unclear about how AI systems work, what
      information is safe to share, and how to use AI for learning without
      crossing into cheating or plagiarism.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Following consultation with district stakeholders, I designed an
      in-person, four-lesson mini-unit. This format supports peer discussion as
      students work through realistic AI safety and ethics scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      In-person instruction also enables collaborative creation of a final
      “AI Code of Honor,” giving students shared ownership of the commitments
      established by the class.

<!-- PROCESS -->
<section class="band band-project">
  <div class="band-inner">
    <h2>My Process</h2>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Using the ADDIE model, I began with an analysis of the instructional
      problem, desired outcomes, learners, and learning environment. I
      interviewed classroom teachers and the district curriculum director to
      identify key concerns regarding AI use at this grade level.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also conducted student interviews to understand prior knowledge,
      perceptions, and preferences related to AI tools.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      Based on analysis findings, I established three primary learning goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students can distinguish between safe and unsafe information to share with AI tools.</li>
      <li>Students can identify common red-flag patterns in AI messages.</li>
      <li>Students can recognize the difference between learning support and cheating.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To assess these goals, I designed a culminating performance task: a
      collaboratively created AI Code of Honor.
    </p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      I developed the full set of student-facing materials and teacher guides,
      reviewing all content for clarity and accessibility. A small usability
      pilot was conducted to identify areas for refinement.
    </p>

    <h3>Planned Implementation &amp; Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of this portfolio submission, the unit has been fully designed
      but has not yet completed a full in-class pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      During implementation, I plan to observe student engagement, review
      contributions to the AI Code of Honor, and collect teacher feedback.
      Success will be measured by students’ ability to accurately evaluate
      scenarios and articulate ethical reasoning.
